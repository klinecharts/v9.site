### Module dependencies
<ProjectModuleExplain/>
The above diagram shows the hierarchy of chart modules from top to bottom, with the lower layer serving as the upper layer container.
- `Figure` Basic shapes, such as circle, polygon, rect, text, etc.
- `View` Retrieve data from `ChartStore` and perform single business plotting, such as candlesticks, area, grid line, crosshair, indicator, etc
- `Widget` Create canvas and assemble the relevant `View` together.
- `Pane` Create dom container and assemble the `Widget` together.
- `Chart` Manage the Panes, such as deleting and adding operations, to form the final chart. In addition, event distribution is also carried out to manipulate the data in `ChartStore` and notify subordinate components to update as needed.
